1.Go to your Jenkins-Ansible server and create a new directory called ansible-config-artifact

`sudo mkdir /home/ubuntu/ansible-config-artifact`

2.Change permissions to this directory, so Jenkins could save files there 

`sudo chmod -R 777 /home/ubuntu/ansible-config-artifact`

3.Go to Jenkins web console -> Manage Jenkins -> Manage Plugins -> on Available tab search for Copy Artifact and install this plugin without restarting Jenkins

4.Create a new Freestyle project (you have done it in Project 9) and name it save_artifacts

![save artifact freestyle project created](Images/save-artifact.jpgImages/save-artifact.png)

5.This project will be triggered by completion of your existing ansible project. Configure it accordingly:

![save artifact settings](Images/save-artifact-setting1.png)

6.create a Build step and choose Copy artifacts from other project, specify ansible as a source project and /home/ubuntu/ansible-config-artifact as a target directory.

7.Test your set up by making some change in README.MD file inside your ansible-config-mgt repository (right inside master branch)

##Step 2 â€“ Refactor Ansible code by importing other playbooks into site.yml

1.create a new file and name it site.yml

2.Create a new folder in root of the repository and name it static-assignments.

3.Move common.yml file into the newly created static-assignments folder

4.Inside site.yml file, import common.yml playbook

---
- hosts: all
- import_playbook: ../static-assignments/common.yml

![Structure for playbooks](./Images/playbooks.png)

5.Run ansible-playbook command against the dev environment

[]create another playbook under static-assignments and name it common-del.yml

---
- name: update web, nfs and db servers
  hosts: webservers, nfs, db
  remote_user: ec2-user
  become: yes
  become_user: root
  tasks:
  - name: delete wireshark
    yum:
      name: wireshark
      state: removed

- name: update LB server
  hosts: lb
  remote_user: ubuntu
  become: yes
  become_user: root
  tasks:
  - name: delete wireshark
    apt:
      name: wireshark-qt
      state: absent
      autoremove: yes
      purge: yes
      autoclean: yes

[]update site.yml with - import_playbook: ../static-assignments/common-del.yml instead of common.yml and run it against dev servers

`cd /home/ubuntu/ansible-config-mgt/`
